     * A loop is associated to one and only one face.
     * 
     * A loop can be seen as a list of edges, it also stores a reference to a
     * vertex for commodity but technically it could be found through the edge.
     * It may also be interpreted as a "face corner", and is hence where one
     * typically stores UVs, because one vertex may have different UV
     * coordinates depending on the face.
     * 
     * On top of this, the loop is also used as a node of another linked list,
     * namely the radial list, that enables iterating over all the faces using
     * the same edge.
